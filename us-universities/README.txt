A list of United States universities. Much credit goes to the original list at http://doors.stanford.edu/~sr/universities.html (Standford University). The geocordinates come from the Google Places API.

It is important to note that some of the street addresses come from a Google maps search for the University Library, Student Union, Admissions offices etc.
